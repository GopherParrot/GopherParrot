Hi again! I like Origami (折り紙)\n
But Parrot, what the flip is that Japanese word you asked? let me explain:\n
Ori (折り) = fold\n
Kami (紙) = paper\n
or "fold paper", it's the art of folding a single sheet of paper into a desired shape without cutting, gluing, or marking :)\n
I also working with Kirigami (切り紙) and Kumiko (組子) beside coding.
